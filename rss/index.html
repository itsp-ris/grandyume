The St. Louis Cardinals, New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, and San Francisco Giants round out the list (Figure I). The top five teams change yearly, but one thing remains constant: the LA Dodgers are always at the top of the list (Figure II). Although it&apos;s estimated that 70% of their high attendance is due to their home stadium capacity, the clubs don&apos;t always play at home - it&apos;d be ignorant to proclaim them the most valued team based on that number alone.</p><p>Besides tickets and concessions businesses, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2022/03/24/baseballs-most-valuable-teams-2022-yankees-hit-6-billion-as-new-cba-creates-new-revenue-streams/?sh=759ff29d600a">Forbes stated LA Dodgers contracted the highest local cable television rights fees in 2021, followed by NY Yankees</a>. Both are among the top five for average viewership in the 2022 season. Citing these data, both teams have a sizable fanbase contributing to merchandise sales, endorsement sales, sponsorship appeals, etc., on top of the above.

This time though, it seems true? Lockdown from the coronavirus prevented the audience from attending the stadium.

The budget allocated to drafting players would&apos;ve decreased because teams weren&apos;t earning. Hence, Major League Baseball (MLB) and Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) reached a consensus to reduce the draft to five rounds. The numbers in the following year rose but were still lower than pre-pandemic since it started switching to 20 rounds from 40.</p><p>The MLB owners&apos; cost-cutting measure should not be misinterpreted as a reduced number of amateur baseball players in high schools, colleges, and other amateur baseball clubs. In fact, Statista analysis claims <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/267954/participation-in-us-high-school-baseball/">steady growth in the number of participants in U.S. high school baseball</a>.
