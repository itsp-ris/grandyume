This time though, it seems true? Lockdown from the coronavirus prevented the audience from attending the stadium. Tickets weren&apos;t sold, cheers weren&apos;t heard, the atmosphere wasn&apos;t engaging, etc. The recent delay from the labor dispute pulled the last straw and made baseball&apos;s death seem near.</p><p>But it isn&apos;t.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/05/total-drafted-players.png" class="kg-image" alt="Is Baseball Really Over?" loading="lazy" width="381" height="278"><figcaption>Figure I: The total number of drafted players from 2016 to 2021.</figcaption></figure><p>The total number of drafted players stayed consistently at around 1200 from 2016 to 2019. But why did it drop in 2020 (Figure I)?</p><p>Then, coronavirus struck the world and caused delayed games, and ballpark concessions businesses fell. The budget allocated to drafting players would&apos;ve decreased because teams weren&apos;t earning. Hence, Major League Baseball (MLB) and Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) reached a consensus to reduce the draft to five rounds. The numbers in the following year rose but were still lower than pre-pandemic since it started switching to 20 rounds from 40.</p><p>The MLB owners&apos; cost-cutting measure should not be misinterpreted as a reduced number of amateur baseball players in high schools, colleges, and other amateur baseball clubs. In fact, Statista analysis claims <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/267954/participation-in-us-high-school-baseball/">steady growth in the number of participants in U.S. high school baseball</a>. On another note, opportunities for late bloomers are narrower now that teams will make stricter decisions with only limited pick rounds to exhaust.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/06/tweet-freq.png" class="kg-image" alt="Is Baseball Really Over?" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="1520" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2022/06/tweet-freq.png 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2022/06/tweet-freq.png 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/06/tweet-freq.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Figure II: The daily tweet frequency for one month since the start of the 2022 MLB season.</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/06/tweet-sentiment-proportions.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Is Baseball Really Over?" loading="lazy" width="673" height="605" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2022/06/tweet-sentiment-proportions.jpg 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/06/tweet-sentiment-proportions.jpg 673w"><figcaption>Figure III: The proportions of negative, neutral, and positive tweets in the first month of the 2022 MLB season.</figcaption></figure><p>Following the draft, rosters were replenished, and fans were excited for the opening day after the delay (Figure II). Positive tweets under the #MLB hashtags substantially surpassed negative tweets (Figure III). The hype later died down, but MLB is considerably conversed about from the peaks and troughs throughout the rest of the month (Figure II).

What does this tell us? The sport, in particular, is still marketable and valuable for investment. <a href="https://itsp-ris.github.io/grandyume/dodgers-vs-yankees-whos-the-most-valuable-team">Attendance</a> and <a href="https://sportsnaut.com/mlb-ratings-tv-viewership-numbers/">viewership</a> are bouncing up post-pandemic, which will surely drive more sponsorships and endorsements.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/05/bachelor-enrollment-2016-2020-1.png" width="428" height="547" loading="lazy" alt="Is Baseball Really Over?"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/05/doctor-enrollement-2016-2020.png" width="428" height="547" loading="lazy" alt="Is Baseball Really Over?"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/05/master-enrollement-2016-2020.png" width="428" height="547" loading="lazy" alt="Is Baseball Really Over?"></div></div></div><figcaption>Figure IV: The enrollment count from 2016 to 2020 for sports-related bachelor&apos;s, doctor&apos;s, and master&apos;s courses.</figcaption></figure><p>College enrollments in sports-related fields, namely parks, recreation, leisure, fitness, and kinesiology, also displayed an increasing trend in the recent five years (Figure IV). These have yet to include studies such as data science or advanced statistics in sports. If those were included, the enrollment rate had stretched more given the constant interest in, for example, sabermetrics (Figure V).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/05/data-in-baseball.PNG" width="1920" height="844" loading="lazy" alt="Is Baseball Really Over?" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/data-in-baseball.PNG 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/data-in-baseball.PNG 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2022/05/data-in-baseball.PNG 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/05/data-in-baseball.PNG 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/05/sabermetrics.PNG" width="1920" height="842" loading="lazy" alt="Is Baseball Really Over?" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/sabermetrics.PNG 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/sabermetrics.PNG 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2022/05/sabermetrics.PNG 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/05/sabermetrics.PNG 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/05/stats-in-baseball.PNG" width="1920" height="844" loading="lazy" alt="Is Baseball Really Over?" srcset="http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/stats-in-baseball.PNG 600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/stats-in-baseball.PNG 1000w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/size/w1600/2022/05/stats-in-baseball.PNG 1600w, http://localhost:2368/content/images/2022/05/stats-in-baseball.PNG 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption>Figure V: The google trend for the phrases &quot;data in baseball&quot;, &quot;sabermetrics&quot; and, &quot;stats in baseball&quot; respectively from 2017 to 2021.</figcaption></figure><p>In conclusion, the world isn&apos;t ready to abandon baseball, or for that matter, any sport, despite the hype around the digital world where we sit unmoving in front of a screen. The glory days of MLB may well be over, but the statistics aren&apos;t indicating a fall so critical for baseball to finish just yet. With the situation and teams recovering, we have yet to see raw data without implications.
